Done:
25
Basic rendering: The T and L specifiers work as required, and L-Systems without the save/load specifiers [ and ] render correctly for any number of iterations. All of the required transformations work as required.

10
The save/load specifiers [ and ] work for any number of iterations and any depth of nesting.

5
Improved rendering: Gradient or textured rendering is used instead of flat colours.

5
Interesting inputs: New L-Systems with complicated behavior (and which are your own work) are included in your submission.

4
Extra geometric primitives (besides the branch and leaf) are implemented. Demonstration files must be included to show these in use.

5
The L-System is rendered more than once in different positions and orientations (for example, to produce a forest instead of a single tree). Transformations are also used to produce perspective or shadow effects.

8
The implementation can render L-Systems beyond the simple branch/tree models used in this specification (for example, you could receive full marks in this section by making your program render all of the examples in the Wikipedia article).



Todo:
8
The implementation allows the window to be resized at any time by the user, and the drawing perspective and aspect ratio are scaled proportionally to fit the new window size.
