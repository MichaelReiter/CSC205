DONE

18
The 5 × 5 Gaussian blur filter functions correctly on a variety of test inputs.

2
The value of σ for the Gaussian blur filter can be changed at run time by the user (for example, by providing it as a command line parameter).

18
The Laplace edge sharpening program functions correctly on a variety of test inputs.

2
The value of w in the edge sharpening equation can be changed at run time by the user (for example, by providing it as a command line parameter).

8
For all of the filtering programs, out-of-bounds pixels are handled with reflection or smearing (instead of assuming all out-of-bounds pixels have a constant value).



TODO

16
The program for histogram matching against the function f(x) given in Section 1.1 functions correctly on a variety of test images.

16
The program for histogram matching against the function g(x) given in Section 1.1 functions correctly on a variety of test images.

6
A second Gaussian blur filter which uses separate 5 × 1 and 1 × 5 filters to perform the blur is implemented and functions correctly.

6
An additional Leplacian-of-Gaussian edge sharpening program is implemented and functions correctly.
